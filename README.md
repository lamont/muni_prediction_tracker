# muni_prediction_tracker
picks a few muni routes/stops we care about and dumps them into our house event database

This is just a quick wrapper around the muni gem that picks a few stops near our house. We'll dump that into jut, then use 
their display boards to give us a quick "how long till we need to be at the stop to catch that train"
